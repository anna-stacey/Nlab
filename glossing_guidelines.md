# Nɬab Glossing Guidelines
##### Compiled by Anna Stacey

Based on a four-line gloss style (i.e., transcription, segmentation, gloss, translation).

Unless otherwise specified, examples are from Hannon et al. (2023).  Examples are marked with the initals of their speaker, as follows:
 - CMA: *C̓úʔsinek* (Marty Aspinall)
 - BP: Bev Phillips
 - KBG: *Kʷəɬtèzetkʷuʔ* (Bernice Garcia)

Our starting point was provided by the Nɬeʔkepmxcín grammar (Thompson and Thompson, 1992) and Nɬeʔkepmxcín-English dictionary (Thompson and Thompson, 1996).

## Morpheme Boundaries

Morpheme boundaries should match between the segmentation and gloss lines.  Boundary types (i.e., which symbol is used) should also match.  
Word boundaries should match between transcription, segmentation, and gloss lines (with the exception of clitics, as explained [below](#clitics)).

#### Regular Morphemes
The hyphen (-) is the default boundary used to separate morphemes.  
Note that this includes lexical suffixes, as they are not indicated by their own boundary type (unlike for Thompson and Thompson (1992, 1996), who used '=' for this purpose).

#### Reduplicating Morphemes
Reduplication is marked with a tilde (~), unless the morpheme is also an infix, in which case it justs get infixing marking (see [next section](#infixes)).  Reduplicating affixes are:
- the affectative (AFF~)
- <u>the augmentative (AUG~) / plural (PL~)</u>
- the characteristic (~CHR)
- the diminuitive (\<DIM\>)
- the out-of-control (~OOC)
- the proportional (~PRP)

For example:
> ʔeɬ e **ʔe**ʔúseʔs nem y̓emíns xéʔe  
ʔeɬ e=**ʔe~**&ZeroWidthSpace;ʔ-úseʔ-s nem y̓e-mín-[t]-∅-s xéʔe  
and DET=**AFF~**&ZeroWidthSpace;NEUT-small.round.object-3POSS very good-RLT-TR-3OBJ-3ERG DEM  
‘And the duck eggs, he really liked those.’ (KBG)

#### Infixes
Infixes are marked with angle brackets (<>).  Infixes are:
- the diminuitive (\<DIM\>)
- the inchoative *ʔ* (not *ə́p*) (\<INCH\>)
- the plural (\<PL\>)
 
For example:
> ƛ̓é**ƛ̓**zm xéʔe tk scúw e záq̓m tuw e píx̣m.  
ƛ̓é&ZeroWidthSpace;**\<ƛ̓>**&ZeroWidthSpace;z-m xéʔe t=k=s-cúw e=záq̓-m tuw=e=píx̣-m  
easy&ZeroWidthSpace;**\<DIM>**-CTR.MID DEM OBL=DET=NMLZ-do D/C=bake.bread-CTR.MID than=D/C=hunt-CTR.MID  
‘It’s easier to bake bread than to hunt.’
(Hall, 2023; BP)

#### Clitics
Clitics are marked with an equals sign (=).  The following morphemes are clitics:
- possessive morphology (1SG.POSS=, =3POSS, etc.) on clauses, but not on noun phrases
- intransitive subject-markers (=1SG.SBJ, etc.)
- subjunctive morphology (=1SG.SBJV, =3SBJV, etc.)
- complementizers <u>(COMP=/HYP=)</u>
- determiners (DET=)
- determiner/complementizers (D/C=)
- evidentials (=INFER, =RPRT, =SENSE)
- from/than (from=/than=)
- <u>the locative (LOC=) only when used as a preposition</u>
- the nominalizer (NMLZ=) on clauses, but not on NPs
- the oblique marker (OBL=)
- the question marker *n̓* (not *keʔ*) (=Q)

Note that clitics are the one case where there can be discrepancies in **word boundaries** between the transcription line vs. the segmentation and gloss lines.  Consider the example below.  The clitic *e=* 'DET' is written as a separate word in the transcription line, but attached to the stem in the segmentation and gloss lines.  But this is not the case for all clitics, as *s=* 'NMLZ' is attached to the stem in all three lines.  In summary, all clitics will be attached to the stem in the segmentation and gloss lines, but whether or not they're attched in the transcription line is just based on orthographic convention and varies by clitic.
> ʔeɬ xeym tʔé tʔé témn̓ **s**wéwtiyxs **e** séytknmx kwntiyxs e néʔ eh s ʔe sutn  
ʔeɬ xeym tʔé tʔé témn̓ **s=**&ZeroWidthSpace;wéw[-n]-t-∅-iyxs **e=**&ZeroWidthSpace;séytkn-mx kwn[-n]-t-∅-iyxs e=néʔ eh s ʔe=sutn  
and indeed DEM DEM then **NMLZ=**&ZeroWidthSpace;call-CTR-TR-3OBJ-3PL.ERG **DET=**&ZeroWidthSpace;people-person get-CTR-TR-3OBJ-3PL.ERG D/C=DEM eh s DET=thing  
‘Long time ago, when the women used to gather and dance, they would call the people, and they grabbed something.’ (CMA)

Clitics that are **separate** in the transcription line (like *e=* 'DET' above) are:
- intransitive subject-markers
- subjunctive morphology
- determiners
- determiner/complementizers
- evidentials
- the oblique marker
- the question marker

Clitics that are **attached** in the transcription line (like *s=* 'NMLZ' above) are:
- possessive morphology
- the locative
- the nominalizer

Finally, some clitic clusters are written in the transcription line separate from their stem, but attached to one another.  For example, this is typical with combinations of OBL and a DET or D/C:
>ƛ̓uʔ nem y̓e **tək** sɬaʔx̣áns  
ƛ̓uʔ nem y̓e **tə=k**=s-ɬaʔx̣-áns  
also very good **OBL=DET**=NMLZ-eat-tooth  
‘They are good to eat.’ (CMA)

<u>A list of clitics we cluster together in the orthography</u>:

- *k=eʔ= (k=éʔ=)* (always x6) (D/C=2SG.POSS=)
- *k=s=* (sometimes) (D/C=NMLZ=)
- *n=e=* (sometimes) (in=DET=)
- *t=e=* (sometimes) (OBL=DET=)
- *t=ə=* (always) (OBl=DET=)
- *te=k=* (always x1) (OBL=DET=)
- *tə=k=* (always) (OBL=DET=, OBL=D/C=)
- *t=k=* (almost always) (OBL=DET=)
- *təw=e* (always x2) (PREP=D/C=)
- *w=e=* (sometimes) (to=DET=)
- *we=ɬ* (always x2) (PREP=DET=)
- *k=e=s=* (x1) (D/C=IPFV=NMLZ=)
- *t=e=s=* (x1) (OBL=DET=NMLZ=)

## Capturing Unrealized Morphology
Because of phonological processes, there is often a conflict between wanting to capture what is pronounced vs. what is underlying.  This frequently comes up with transitive morphology.  For example, consider a transitive form of *cún* 'say':
> cúnc  
cún[-n]-t-∅-es  
say-CTR-TR-3.OBJ-3.ERG  

There are lots of decisions involved in how to display this word.  Assuming we want the transcription line to be true to what was said, then we will leave it as is.  But rather than breaking down the segmentation as above, we could imagine something like:
> cúnc  
cún-c  
say-CTR+TR+3OBJ+3ERG  

Both options convey what's going on, they just differ in how much they unpack the morphology and prioritize what's underlying.  We have decided to go with the first option above, with the following general guidelines in place:
- Write the transcription line as pronounced.
- Include underlying forms in the segmentation (and gloss) lines.  This refers to to cases where you can know a morpheme must be there even when it's not realized (e.g., the transitivizer must be present if we have transitive agreement suffixes).
    - If the morpheme is completely unrealized in the transcription line, include it (and the relevant boundary) in square brackets.  For example:
        > náq̓ʷms  
        náq̓ʷ-m[in]**[-t]**-∅-s  
        steal-RLT-TR-3OBJ-3ERG
    - If the morpheme is partly realized in the gloss line, include the full morpheme in the segmentation line and put just the unrealized part in brackets.  For example:
        > náq̓ʷms  
        náq̓ʷ-**m[in]**[-t]-∅-s  
        steal-RLT-TR-3OBJ-3ERG
    - If the morpheme has undergone a phonological process but is clearly still identifiable in the transcription line (e.g., underlying 't' and 's' are frequently captured as 'c' in the transcription), include the morpheme in the segmentation line with no brackets or special treatment.  For example:
        > snescút  
        s=nes-**t-sút**  
        NMLZ=go-TR-REFL
- Include null morphemes (with ∅ in the segmentation line, and no special treatment in the gloss line).  These convey important information to the reader!
- No brackets used in the gloss line - the gloss for a bracketed morpheme can be written as normal.
